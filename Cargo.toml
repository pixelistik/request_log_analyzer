Extracts some performance metrics from the request.log of a CQ/AEM instance.

Example output:
count:          54510 (number of analyzed requests)
time.avg:       127
time.min:       1
time.median:    6
time.90percent: 27
time.99percent: 3614
time.max:       15747 (times are in milliseconds)

Note: When analyzing more than 10.000 lines, median and percentiles are
approximated for performance.
